      conversations. It is compulsory to have a session when
      using WebScarab, because each conversation is written to
      the session  as it is seen, and read back from the session
      when
      requested.
    </p><p>At the moment, sessions can only be saved to a directory
      on the filesystem. When creating a new session, you should
      select an empty directory, or provide the name of a
      directory  that should be created.
    </p><p>When WebScarab starts up, it prompts you to choose what
      kind of session to use. The default option is to create a 
      temporary session. This temporary session is a directory
      created  in the ${java.io.tmpdir} directory, using a
      pattern of 
      webscarabnnnnn.tmp.
    </p><p>
      <span class="emphasis"><em>Note:</em></span>This temporary directory is
      deleted  when WebScarab exits. If you wish to preserve the
      audit
      record  for later review, you should start a new session
      before
      creating or intercepting any conversations. Alternatively,
      if  you need to save a temporary session that already
      contains
      conversations, you should <span class="emphasis"><em>NOT</em></span> exit
      WebScarab.  First change to a  new session, or open an
      existing session. This causes
      WebScarab  to flush some memory-based data structures to
      disk. Then
      copy  or move the temporary session directory to a new
      location.  
    </p><p>
      <span class="emphasis"><em>Note:</em></span>It could be really useful for
      WebScarab to store its sessions in a SQL database. Each of
      the  plugins have been implemented with an interface to its
      "datastore". As mentioned, there is currently a 
      FileSystemStore
      implementation of these interfaces, which could be used as
      a template for implementing a SQLStore. For standalone
      use,  WebScarab could use HSQLDB, or could be configured to
      use
      an external database such as Oracle or PostgreSQL. This
      would be a  great feature for an interested person to
      contribute to
      WebScarab.
