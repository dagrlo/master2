      to manually consume a SOAP web service. The plugin automatically 
      identifies conversations that contain WSDL documents, and
      presents them in a drop down list for selection.</p><p>One can also type in the URL manually, which will 
      result in the plugin retrieving the WSDL. If the WSDL is 
      not accessible via an HTTP or HTTPS url, the operator can also 
      access a local copy of the WSDL by simply providing the path to the
      local copy in the WSDL URL field, and pressing Load.</p><p>The plugin then presents the available services and 
      operations, and automatically populates a tree containing
      the parameters that the service requires.</p><p>The operator can then press the "Execute" button
      to submit the request the server, and receive the response.</p><p>At the moment, the web services plugin is still very immature,
      and is likely to be buggy. At the very least, this initial implementation
      only has support for RPC/encoded transports.</p></div></body></html>
