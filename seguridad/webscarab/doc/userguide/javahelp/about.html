      auspices of the Open Web Application Security Project
      (OWASP). The aim of WebScarab is to provide a free (beer as
      well as speech) tool for web application developers and
      reviewers to use to understand the functioning of web
      applications, and to identify possible problems that could
      cause those web applications to malfunction.
    </p><p>WebScarab is licensed under the GNU General Public
      License v2.
    </p><p>WebScarab is based on a plugin architecture. Currently,
      the plugins are mostly security focused, but I'm sure that
      "normal" web developers would also be able to benefit from
      some of the plugins, such as the Proxy and Manual Request
      plugins.
    </p><p>WebScarab is a powerful tool, and as with many tools, can
      be used for good as well as for bad. In the hands of the
      white-hats, WebScarab can help them to find
      vulnerabilities, and make sure that those vulnerabilities
      are fixed as soon as possible. In the hands of the
      black-hats, WebScarab allows them to find and possibly
      exploit vulnerabilities.
