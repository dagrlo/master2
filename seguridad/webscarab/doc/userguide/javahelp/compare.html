        degree of difference between
        a number of responses. This is useful when you have
        issued a number of requests 
        for a particular URL, possibly via the Scripted plugin,
        and would like to evaluate
        the results. Obviously, if you can eliminate groups of
        identical responses at once,
        you can save yourself some time.
      </p><p>Choose the "base" conversation against which others
        should be compared, using 
        the drop down list. The Conversation table will be
        populated with conversations,
        and the Difference column will indicate the number of
        words that differ in the 
        responses. The number is actually the Levenshtein Edit
        Distance, showing the number
        of edits (inserts, changes, and deletes) that are
        required to transform
        the base response into the current target. For speed
        reasons, the response content
        is tokenised into words, since the Levenshtein
        algorithm is O(n*m), and slows
        down quickly for large numbers of comparisons.
      </p><p>The two responses are then displayed side by side in
        the lower half
        of the window, to make it easy to compare them.
