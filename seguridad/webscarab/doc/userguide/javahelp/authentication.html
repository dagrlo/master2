        Basic, NTLM and Negotiate (not Kerberos) authentication. The first time a server requests 
        authentication, WebScarab will prompt for credentials. These credentials will be reused for 
        subsequent requests when required by the web server or proxy.
      </p><p><span class="emphasis"><em>Note:</em></span> The credentials used will be included as
        a fake header in the request when the conversation is archived. This is intended to allow
        for automatic replay of a request using the credentials that were active at the time the request was issued.
        If you wish to replay the request with different (or no) credentials, make sure to 
        delete the "Authorization" or "Proxy-Authorization" header from the request.
