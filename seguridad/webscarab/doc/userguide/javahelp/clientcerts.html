        certificates. It can access keys and certificates
        stored in PKCS#12 format files, as well as using PKCS#11 tokens
        on the Java 1.5 platform. 
        This functionality is accessed via the Tools-&gt;Certificates menu.
        Simply choose the "Add Keystore" button, and select the type of keystore to
        add. If it is a PKCS#12 store, provide the file location, and the keystore
        password. If it is a PKCS#11 keystore, you need to give the store an arbitrary name,
        as well as specifying the location of the PKCS#11 library that Java should use to access the token.
        You also need to provide the password for accessing the token.
      </p><p>Once keystores have been configured, you can see the details of the certificates
        in the keystores. Clicking on the certificate alias will display the details of the certificate.
      </p><p>To activate a particular certificate, select "Activate selected Alias". 
        You may be prompted for a password to use to access the key. 
        To stop using any client certificate, make sure that no alias is selected (Ctrl-Click if necessary),
        and select "Activate selected Alias".
      </p><p>You can see which alias is currently active in the "Active key" text field.
      </p><p><span class="emphasis"><em>Note:</em></span> The fingerprint of the client certificate will be included as
        a fake header in the request when the conversation is archived. This is intended to allow
        for automatic replay of a request using the client certificate that was selected at the time the request was issued.
        If you wish to replay the request with a different (or no) certificate, make sure to 
        delete the "X-SSLClientCertificate" header from the request.
