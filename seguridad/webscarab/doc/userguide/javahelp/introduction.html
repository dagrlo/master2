      It provides a foundation for the plugins to generate
      requests  and responses (aka conversations), keep an audit
      record of
      these conversations, and review what those conversations
      were,  as well as a tree view of the URL's that have been
      "seen".
    </p><p>It also passes all of the conversations that the
      framework sees to all of the plugins that are installed.
      This  allows each plugin to perform some analysis of each
      conversation.
    </p><p>Other services that the framework itself provides are
      handling of upstream proxy servers, client side
      certificates, a pool of cookies that have been seen or set
      by various
      plugins,  and a convenient way to perform various encodings
      and
      decoding  of strings.
