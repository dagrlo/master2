        combination of values at a
        server. It is still a little rough, but functionally,
        it works pretty
        well. The idea is that you configure the request
        method, the basic URL
        (without any parameters), the request version, any
        headers (e.g. a Host:
        header if you are using HTTP/1.1, etc. Don't configure
        cookies here!),
        and a list of Parameters.
      </p><p>A Parameter is defined by its location (Path,
        Fragment, Query, Cookie,
        Body), its name (ignored for Path), type == String,
        Default value, Fuzz
        Priority, and a fuzz source.
      </p><p>The default value is the value that will be submitted
        if no fuzz source
        is defined.
      </p><p>The fuzz priority defines how the various fuzz
        sources are combined: if
        all the priorities are the same value, the number of
        queries submitted
        will be the number of items in the shortest fuzz
        source. If they are
        different values, the number of queries generated will
        be the product of
        the number of items in each level.
      </p><p>An example would be if you had a list of usernames
        and passwords. If
        both username and password parameters had the same
        priority, usernames
        and passwords would be consumed in lock-step. If they
        had different
        priorities, EVERY password would be tried for each
        username.
      </p><p>Parameters are processed in order, first path, then
        fragment, then
        query, then cookie, then body. The only content type
        supported for POST
        Requests is application/x-www-urlencoded, it does not
        support multi-part
        (although provision is made for parameters of different
        types, e.g.
        File), or XML documents, etc. Multi-part and XML will
        be the next evolution.
