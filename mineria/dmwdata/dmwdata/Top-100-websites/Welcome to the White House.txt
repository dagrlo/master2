                              the Economy
                               President Bush on Monday said, "One, the tax 
                              relief helped small businesses a lot. And since 
                              small businesses create two-thirds of the new jobs 
                              of America, it is no wonder that our job base is 
                              expanding. When you help the small business owner 
                              with tax relief, you're helping to create 
                              employment. And that's what we're seeing across 
                              the country."

                              In his weekly radio address President Bush said, 
                              "Our economy prospers when Americans like you make 
                              the decisions on how to spend, save, and invest 
                              your money. So the tax relief we passed cut taxes 
                              for everyone who pays income taxes. ... By keeping 
                              taxes low and adopting sound policies that help 
                              our workers to compete and our businesses to grow 
                              and expand, we will keep the economy moving 
                              forward and extend prosperity and hope in our 
                              country."

                               President Bush on Thursday said, "The great thing 
                              about the entrepreneur in the small business 
                              sector of our economy is that you provide great 
                              steam and strength to the growth of our economy. 
                              And today I want to talk to you about why the 
                              small business owner is at the cornerstone of our 
                              pro-growth economic policies, and what we intend 
                              to do to make sure that the environment for taking 
                              risk is strong and viable here in this country."
