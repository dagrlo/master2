            Last Day to File Your Taxes 

            I never cease to be amazed at the last minute rush to file taxes. 
            Every year the irs.gov graph goes bonkers for 1 day.

            Some handy links: 
              IRS Form 4868 - File for an extension 
              IRS 
              IRS E-File

            Alexa Site Facelift 

            We just pushed out a few changes to the Alexa site and I'm pretty 
            excited about them. Some of these have been in the hopper for a 
            while.

            Top Sites by Country . Now, in addition to Top Sites by Language and 
            Top Sites by Subject, we are offering Top Sites by Country.

            Recently Viewed. This new feature only works for users of the Alexa 
            Toolbar. When you are looking at several sites in succession and go 
            to an Alexa Site Info page, we will show you the last 5 sites you've 
            visited so that you can quickly go to site info pages for each.

            Traffic Graph Enhancements. Our enhancements may not be as cool as 
            Alexaholic, but they are a significant improvement. We've extended 
            the maximum time frame and fixed some minor annoyances. Example.

            Feedback.

            Facebook For Sale 

            As long as we are on the topic of social networking sites like 
            MySpace, Facebook, the college equivalent of MySpace, has been 
            making noises about being up for sale, as reported in a recent 
            Businessweek article. A comparison of the two sites reveals some 
            interesting stuff. Like this for example:

            MySpace sold for $580 million last year... Facebook is looking for 
            about $2 Billion.

            Quite a markup. That's more than a 3X increase in the pricetag. So 
            what makes Facebook so much more valuable? Does it have more page 
            views?

            No. While there are no definitive statistics available, we can look 
            to companies like Alexa or ComScore to give us some idea. According 
            to ComScore, MySpace gets 4X as many pageturns as Facebook. 
            According to Alexa, it is even more dramatic. Myspace has more than 
            10X as many pageturns and 6X as many visitors.

            So who would be crazy enough to buy Facebook at these inflated 
            prices? Sumner Redstone. Not to be outdone by Rupert Murdoch's News 
            Corp, who bought MySpace last year, media mogul Sumner Redstone's 
            Viacom is rumored to be eyeing the bait.

            I guess we'll have to wait and see what happens, but if it happens 
            then it will be confirmed: Rupert Murdoch got the deal of the 
            century when he bought Myspace.
