       Welcome! 
      The Apache Software Foundation provides support for the Apache community 
      of open-source software projects. The Apache projects are characterized by 
      a collaborative, consensus based development process, an open and 
      pragmatic software license, and a desire to create high quality software 
      that leads the way in its field. We consider ourselves not simply a group 
      of projects sharing a server, but rather a community of developers and 
      users.
       Support the Apache Software Foundation 
      You are invited to participate in The Apache Software Foundation. Our 
      membership consists of those individuals who have demonstrated a 
      commitment to collaborative open-source software development through 
      sustained participation and contributions within the Foundation's 
      projects. Of course, you can contribute to the foundation in many ways:

      Announcements List.
      projects.apache.org Now Open 
      Have you ever wondered how to get an idea of all the different projects 
      under the Apache Software Foundation umbrella? Many interesting hours can 
      be spent browsing our project websites to find those interesting gems. But 
      now there is also an alternative.
      We are happy to introduce the projects.apache.org website. This site 
      contains a catalog of Apache projects and the resources they provide. It 
      is not yet comprehensive, so if you see a project that is missing, ask 
      them to get themselves listed.
