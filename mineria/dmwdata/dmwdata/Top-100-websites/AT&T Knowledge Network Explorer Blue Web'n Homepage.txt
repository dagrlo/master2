                        Blue Web'n is an online library of 2010 outstanding 
                        Internet sites categorized by subject, grade level, and 
                        format (tools, references, lessons, hotlists, resources, 
                        tutorials, activities, projects). You can also browse by 
                        broad subject area (Content Areas) or specific 
                        sub-categories (Subject Area). See "About this Site" for 
                        a scoring rubric and answers to other burning questions!
                        Each month 5-10 new sites are added. You can get a 
                        description of these additions sent to you by signing up 
                        below for free updates! To receive email updates, send 
                        an email message to

                        Select from at least one of the options below, then 
                        click the "Search" button. More selections will yield 
                        fewer matches. To find sites by broad subject area (i.e. 
                        "Foreign Language" or "Earth Science"), browse the 
                        clickable Subject Area list. To find sites sorted by 
                        both subject and format (i.e. "English References" or 
                        "Science Projects"), browse the Content Table. Note: If 
                        you are looking for standards-based materials, select 
                        "Education - Curriculum" from the drop-down Content Area 
                        and enter your subject in "Other Search Terms." Try 
                        "Education - Alternatives" for sites that are close to 
                        being curriculum but aren't standards aligned.
