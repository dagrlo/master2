chamber at New York City's Federal Hall. In a brief address to the Senate, Adams

Biographical Directory 
Who's Who in Congress 
The collective Senate membership of nearly 1,900 men and women is documented in 
the recently published Biographical Directory of the United States Congress, 
1774-2005. Continuing a nearly 150-year tradition, the 2,218-page volume is the 
16th in a series of similar reference works.

The Biographical Directory print edition is complemented and enhanced by a 
frequently updated Web edition. The Web edition can be searched by name, state, 
position, or the year served in Congress. In addition to Member biographies, the 
online database features extensive bibliographies and information on research 
collections that include papers of Senators and Representatives. Nearly all 
Senate entries in the online directory are accompanied by a portrait.  

While the latest print edition of the Biographical Directory is complete, the 
work involved in maintaining senatorial biographies continues, both for the 
online biographical database and for other purposes. New Senators are elected or 
appointed, committee chairships change, and former Members tackle other 
challenges. Newly published biographies often shine a different light on old 
Senate careers.
