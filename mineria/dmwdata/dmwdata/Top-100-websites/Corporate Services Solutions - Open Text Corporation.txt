      Supporting and streamlining your business-critical processes
      Across your organization, core business processes must be supported by 
      standard administrative services and functions. The efficiency and control 
      of those processes depend on it. Corporate Services must help your 
      enterprise meet its unique requirements, such as reduced financial and 
      environmental risk, or improved quality management.
      However, the cost in time and labor is high when you must rely on 
      paper-based documents and processes for administering these Corporate 
      Services. Instead, the implementation of electronic workflow and documents 
      can make the mission-critical difference that ensures success.
      Open Text Solutions for Corporate Services help you meet your business 
      goals through the following processes: 
        Environment, Health & Safety
        Facilities, Fleet & Equipment Management
        Legal
        Performance Monitoring
        Quality Management
        Travel Management
