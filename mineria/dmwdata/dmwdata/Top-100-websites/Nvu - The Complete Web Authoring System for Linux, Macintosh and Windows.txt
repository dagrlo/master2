      Made with NVU!

We really got a lot of feedback asking for an official "Made with Nvu" button so 
here is a code snippet you can include in your web pages to support Nvu and tell 
the world that you like it.

<a href="http://www.nvu.com" hreflang="en"><img src="http://www.nvu.com/made-with-Nvu-t.png" alt="Document made with Nvu" border="0"></a>Please do not make a local copy of the image since we would like to use our web 
server logs to count how many pages include the "Made with Nvu" button. Thanks a 
lot!
In addition to the above "Made with Nvu" graphic, we have included two smaller 
icons for people to use. Use the same procedure described above but replace the 
"src=" line with:
