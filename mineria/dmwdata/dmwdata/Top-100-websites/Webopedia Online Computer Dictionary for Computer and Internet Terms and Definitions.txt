                  Auto Show Puts Networking in the Driver’s Seat
                  Wi-Fi, fiber optics and rolling servers mark cars and trends 
                  at the NY Auto Show.
                  Value-Priced, Big-Screened, AMD-Powered Notebook from Averatec
                  A favorite brand among retail bargain hunters, Averatec has 
                  introduced its first 17-inch widescreen laptop, with features 
                  ranging from dual-layer DVD±RW to a choice of Mobile Sempron 
                  or Turion 64 power and Windows XP Home, Professional, or Media 
                  Center Edition.
                  Are You Threatening Me?
                  D-Link's unified threat management security appliance packs a 
                  huge number of features into one box. However, it also packs a 
                  huge price once you add all the upgrades and subscription 
                  fees. Is it too much for a good thing?
