      The periodic "law" of chemistry recognises that properties of the chemical 
      elements are periodic functions of their atomic number (that is, the 
      number of protons within the element's atomic nucleus). The periodic table 
      is an arrangement of the chemical elements ordered by atomic number in 
      columns (groups) and rows (periods) presented so as to emphasize their 
      periodic properties.
      There are many different ways, sometimes ingenious, of arranging the 
      chemical elements according to which properties are of particular interest 
      but that shown here is a standard form of the periodic table. The relative 
      merits of various other periodic table organisations is still the subject 
      of debate.
      While the name Dmitri Mendeleev is usually credited with the with the form 
      of periodic table as we know it today, many other excellent researchers 
      made profound contributions to its development, including Antoine 
      Lavoisier, Jöns Jakob Berzelius, Johann Döbereiner, John Newlands, 
      Alexandre-Émile Béguyer de Chancourtois, Lothar Meyer, and others.
        WebElements was the first periodic table on the WWW (launched September 
        1993). See also: WebElements Scholar Edition - for chemistry and other 
        students at universities and schools. 
        WebElements aims to be a high quality source of chemistry information on 
        the WWW relating to the periodic table. Coverage is such that 
        professional scientists and students at school interested in chemistry 
        and other sciences will all find something useful.

        On average, more than 45000 people use WebElements every day and there 
        were over 70 million page views in the last 12 months 
        Awards: WebElements is pleased to be the recipient of numerous awards 
        including the Royal Society of Chemistry 1998 HE Teaching Award winner, 
        the ScientificAmerican.com winner of the 2002 Sci/Tech Web Awards, one 
        of the MARS Best of Free Reference Web Sites of 2001 (MARS is the 
        Machine-Assisted Reference Section of the Reference and User Services 
        Association of the American Library Association), featured in the 
        Institute for Scientific Information's (ISI) premium collection of 
        evaluated scholarly Web sites called Current Web Contents., and 
        WebElements is rated as Best of the Web by Britannica.com. Most 
        recently, the MERLOT (Multimedia educational resource for on-line 
        learning and teaching) chemistry editorial board selected "WebElements" 
        as its choice for a Chemistry 2005 Classics Award.
