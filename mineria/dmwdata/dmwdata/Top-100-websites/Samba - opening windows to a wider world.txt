Security Release: Samba 3.0.22 Available for Download
This is a security release of Samba. The Samba 3.0.21 release series (including 
the patch releases a through c) has been discovered to expose the clear text of 
the server's machine account credentials in the winbind log files when the log 
level is set to 5 or higher. Details can be found in the online release notes or 
in the original security announcement for CAN-2006-1059.
The Samba 3.0.22 source code can be downloaded now. The GnuPG signature for the 
uncompressed tarball is also available. If you prefer to download just the diff 
from 3.0.21c to 3.0.22, the patch file (gpg signature) is also available. 
Precompiled packages for Fedora Core 4, RedHat 9, all SuSE platforms, and 
Solaris are available in the Binary_Packages download area. Packages for other 
platforms will be available shortly.

Samba 4.0.0TP2 Available for Download
Samba 4 is the ambitious next version of the Samba suite that is being developed 
in parallel to the stable 3.0 series. The main emphasis in this branch is 
support for the Active Directory logon protocols used by Windows 2000 and above.
Samba 4 is currently not yet in a state where it is usable in production 
environments. Note the STATUS file, which aims to document what should and 
should not work.
With 3 years of development under our belt since Tridge first proposed a new 
Virtual File System (VFS) layer for Samba3 (a project which eventually lead to 
our Active Directory efforts), it was felt that we should create something we 
could 'show off' to our users. This is the second Technology Preview (TP), aimed 
at allowing users, managers and developers to see how we have progressed, and to 
invite feedback and support.
The uncompressed tarball and patch files have been signed with the Samba Release 
Key (ID 157BC95E). The source code can be downloaded now. See the release notes 
for more information.
